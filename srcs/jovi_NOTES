docker exec -it backend pnpm run db:generate;
docker exec -it backend pnpm run db:migrate;


- Added errorPage() in connectFunc:
	- For 401 go back to logIn.ts
- For friends: I added that 'Friens requst' and 'Pending friends' container/box will only appear 
  if they have a friend request or pending friend.
- Added 'delete account' button for user.
- Added username Change.
- Added Password Change with input of current password (NOT WORKING YET, waiting for cookie).
- Finished Admin pages:
	- Admin can Only 'Delete Users' and 'change Password of users' (BTN NOT WORKING YET, waiting for backend routes).


- Added switch between games in dropdown menu.
- ADD score.
- Fixed history.ts ( had the wrong route).
- Fixed match_btn in friends.ts (did not redirect to the user match).


ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO ADD?


Things that are broken:
- History page (NOT GETTING THE CORRECT ROUTE);
- Friends.ts add and match btn does not work; 
- Friend.ts does not redicect to the correct user;
- Add score;
- Add delete user (admin);
