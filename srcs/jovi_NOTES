Things that are broken:
- Settings: if user gives the wrong current password, it goes to 401. (I can't give an error message)
- Friend: does not redirect to the correct user match history. (Julius might already fixed it)
- Admin: can't delete user -> {"error":"FOREIGN KEY constraint failed"}
- Refreshing snek does not work.
- Snek History and Home page are not 100% done.
